Karan Thumar, tur94116@temple.edu (C.S. Major Class of 2027)


Main challenges:

1- Learning how to use the Engine
	- Scenes
	- Nodes
	- Signals
	- Scripts

2- Learning a new language GDScript

3- Not being a very artistic person, so I got assets/art for the game from multiple different asset packs (CC0) just so that it's not just squares and circles.

(4 Finding out late that most of the tutorials on yt were for an older version of godot)
